"""The floating video goes out and comes back in one step, on a local page.

Build first (`./build.sh`), then `python3 Tests/float_settle.py`. A page's
player is sized by its own script 0.4 s after the page is resized, as
YouTube's is: put back in its tab, the page first shows the video at the
size it had in the little window, and only later at its own. The video is
floated and landed with the bench's `film float|land` in a hidden probe
(both windows off every screen), by ⇧⌘P, by switching tabs and by switching
apps. The bench records every frame the page draws and, beside it, what
WebKit has handed over to be drawn and when the covers are up: the video's
frame over the little window, the page as it was left over the tab. Each
must come off only once the page has reached the size it stays at, drawn,
with the video's own picture drawn at the size it is shown, and before its
time limit; and going out, the page never leaves a window.
