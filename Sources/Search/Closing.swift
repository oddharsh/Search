// Tabs that close themselves, as in Arc.
//
// Everything you open is for now, unless you say it is for keeping. A tab you
// haven't looked at for twelve hours (or a day, a week, a month: Settings ›
// Tabs) closes the way ⌘W would close it: ⇧⌘T and History › Recently Closed
// bring it back while it is recent, and History has its page for good. What
// stays is what you said to keep: a pinned tab, a tab you named, a tab in a
// group. There is no fourth way, and no list of exceptions to learn.
//
// The time counts from when you last left the tab, or let go of it (unpinned,
// ungrouped, unnamed: Tab.letGo), and goes on counting while Search is quit:
// the session file carries both (Session.Entry.touched, .letGo).
// Without that, yesterday's tabs would come back each morning as if just
// looked at, and a browser quit every night would never close a thing.
//
// Nothing is closed from under you. The page on screen stays, and so does one
// busy the way a tab kept awake is (Browser.busy): playing, on a call,
// downloading, asking something, or holding something typed and not sent. A
// private tab stays too: nothing could bring it back. A Split View pair goes
// whole or not at all, since half of one left behind has no reason to be there:
// both halves are asked about anything typed before either closes.
//
// Never, unless chosen.
