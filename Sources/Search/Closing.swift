// haven't looked at for twelve hours (or a day, a week, a month: Settings ›
// Tabs) closes the way ⌘W would close it: ⇧⌘T and History › Recently Closed
// bring it back while it is recent, and History has its page for good. What
// stays is what you said to keep: a pinned tab, a tab you named, a tab in a
// group. There is no fourth way, and no list of exceptions to learn.
//
// The time counts from when you last left the tab, and goes on counting while
// Search is quit: the session file carries it (Session.Entry.touched).
// Without that, yesterday's tabs would come back each morning as if just
// looked at, and a browser quit every night would never close a thing.
//
// Nothing is closed from under you. The page on screen stays, and so does one
// busy the way a tab kept awake is (Browser.busy): playing, on a call,
// downloading, asking something, or holding something typed and not sent.
//
// Off unless turned on.
