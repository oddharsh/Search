// A small window for a link from another app: the page, and a thin line over
// it with the site, Open in Search and nothing else — to read and close, or
// to keep. Arc calls it Little Arc; the idea came to Search as #227.
//
// Off unless asked for, in Settings › General: a link from Mail opens in the
// browser's window, as it always has, for anyone who hasn't chosen this.
//
// The page is a tab of its own, as a peek is (see Peek.swift), only in a
// window of its own: Open in Search moves it into the browser's row, where
// the space on screen is, loaded as it is and nothing loaded twice.
//
// It comes alone. The browser's window stays where it was — closed, in the
// Dock, behind another app — until Open in Search asks for it (see
// Links.little).
