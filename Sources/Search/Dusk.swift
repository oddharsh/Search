// Dark pages for sites that have no dark look of their own.
//
// A site that answers prefers-color-scheme already goes dark with the frame
// (see Tab.build), so this is only for the ones that stay white. WebKit has
// no switch for it: Chromium darkens as it paints, and the paint-time filter
// Mail uses (-apple-color-filter) isn't parsed in a web view, flag or no
// flag (macOS 27.2). So a page is darkened in its own colours: each rule of
// its that sets one gets a dark twin (DuskColours.swift), and pictures are
// never touched. The twins take a moment to make, and until they are ready,
// or on a Mac whose WebKit can't do relative colours (before macOS 15), the
// page is turned over with a CSS filter on its root and the pictures on it
// are turned back.
//
// Whether a site needs it is measured, never read off what the site says:
// plenty declare `color-scheme: light dark` and only mean their form
// controls, and plenty more keep a dark theme behind a setting of their own.
// The page's colours are sampled across the screen just before its first
// frame, and again whenever it changes its theme; a site already dark is
// left alone. The filter changes no computed colour, and the twins are set
// aside while it looks, so the measuring always sees the site's own colours.
//
// Off unless turned on in Settings › Appearance, and only ever while the
// frame is dark. ⇧⌘D turns it off, or on, for the site you're on, and is
// kept; ⌥⇧⌘D pauses it everywhere until pressed again or Search quits.
